Bugs:
-qbacklog command needs to switch window forth and back to render
-Queries are partially handled as channels. (makes nickcolor pick a random color in a query)

Features:
-/me
-/ctcp
-Properly render backlog
-Automatic backlog (better be an external perl script)
-Only !hidden buffers

Coding dirts:
-Part of irssi headers are copy/pasted in source code
-There should be no communication between lib/main.c and quassel-irssi itself.
-quassel-fe-windows.c is becoming too big
-lib function provided to the module doesn't have headers
-Same thing for the other way around
