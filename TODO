Bugs:
-qbacklog command needs to switch window forth and back to render
-Queries are partially handled as channels. (makes nickcolor pick a random color in a query)
-Without SSL(even with?), there might be a network deadlock when sending too many requests in a row.
-Queries' buffers are opened only on first message, not on login
-You can't create new query buffer, you can use only already existing ones

Features:
-Properly render backlog
-Automatic backlog (better be an external perl script)
-Only !hidden buffers
