Bugs:
-qbacklog command needs to switch window forth and back to render
-Queries are partially handled as channels. (makes nickcolor pick a random color in a query)

Features:
-Properly render backlog
-Automatic backlog (better be an external perl script)
-Only !hidden buffers

Coding dirts:
-There should be no communication between lib/main.c and quassel-irssi itself.
